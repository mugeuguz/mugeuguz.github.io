Hi, my name is Alperen, and you're reading my bio so thanks for taking an interest!

I'm from originally from Turkey where I lived in various cities such as Mugla, Izmir, Denizli, Ankara.

In August 2021, I graduated from Middle East Technical University Department of Computer Engineering.

I subsequently joined PLUM Lab at University of Maryland at College Park Computer Science Department
as a PhD. student advised by Leonidas Lampropoulos.

I enjoy playing chess(hit me up on Twitter if you're also a chess nerd), writing about my experiences
(you should check my blog), debating, and traveling!
